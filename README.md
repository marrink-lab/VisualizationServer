# VisualizationServer
Managing all issues and suggestions regarding the Visualization Server. This tracking is meant for issues raised by users both inside the Molecular Dynamics group, and users within the University of Groningen.

# Proper usage
Current usage of the VisualizationServer for everyone occurs in a non-forced scheduled manner. For the Molecular Dynamics group we advice booking the server in advance using the MD group calender (a booked person always has priority over a non-booked user!). The server is available during the day and at night. Please keep in mind that as long as you are using the service, nobody else can use it. This means that keeping a session open without actual usage is regarded unwanted. Therefore it is important to log out and close your session whenever you are done with using the service.

## How to raise issues
Each issue is to be raised using the GIT issue tracker at the top of this page. For proper tracking it is important to flag your issues accordingly using the flag system on the right of the issue page. Different flags could be (bug, suggestion, question, etc.). Make sure you use an informative title and add in case of a bug, adding the error message and a reproduction method is extremely useful for resolving the issue.
